# This is an example of settings that can be used as a starting point for analyzing MR data with large(r) (~5mm) slice
# thickness. This is only intended as a starting point and is not likely to be the optimal settings for your dataset.
# Some points in determining better values are added as comments where appropriate

# When adapting and using these settings for an analysis, be sure to add the PyRadiomics version used to allow you to
# easily recreate your extraction at a later timepoint:
